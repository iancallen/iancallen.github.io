# Student Feedback 

"This class was one of my favorites taken here at MSU. The content and professor made the class engaging and enjoyable. For being a longer class, I never felt like I was just waiting for the class to get over. Furthermore, I feel like I learned so much in Micro that I not only learned for the class but retained for my career. That is a compliment I cannot say about a lot of my previous classes. Lastly, Ian is a great professor/is one of the best professors I have had. He was quick to respond to emails, answer questions in class, and made everything make sense. If one student didn't understand, he would explain it as many ways as he could to make sure they did. I believe what makes a good professor is their intention on teaching students to succeed, retain, and learn to learn and he did all of that and beyond. The homework was always just enough of a challenge that it forced us to really think but was also accomplishable at the same time. The repetition in class really helped us as a class to understand concepts we maybe didn't grasp the first time. Overall, I have nothing but wonderful things to say about this course taught by Ian. It is always encouraging to have a class like this."

"I wanted to sincerely thank you for your excellent instruction over the last two semesters. Your level of expertise, clarity with which you can explain difficult ideas, & teaching style have all tremendously improved my learning process. Your dedication to your student's academic success, the way you've set up the classes, and the welcoming environment you've created have been invaluable. I appreciate your commitment. Overall a great professor."

"I really enjoyed both the professor and the class. It is abundantly evident that he truly has the student's best interest in mind and cares about their success in his course. He portrayed all the necessary information in a concise manner and made it as easy as it can be for students. Definitely an excellent professor."

"Great professor, this is the first ECON course I have taken where I actually feel engaged and the content feels relevant. Great examples are brought up during lectures and you can clearly see he is very involved and passionate about the content. Great professor."
