Hello! Welcome to my website.

I'm a research associate at the Center for Analysis of Longitudinal Data in Education Research [(CALDER)](https://caldercenter.org/) and an instructor of economics in the Department of Agricultural Economics and Economics at [Montana State University](https://www.montana.edu/econ/). I hold a M.S. in Applied Economics from Montana State University, a B.A. in Economics, and a B.S. in Statistics, both from Western Washington University.
