Hello! I am a Ph.D. student in the School of Education and Human Development at the [University of Virginia](https://education.virginia.edu/) and an Instructor of Economics in the Department of Agricultural Economics and Economics at [Montana State University](https://www.montana.edu/econ/). Previously, I was a Research Associate at the Center for Analysis of Longitudinal Data in Education Research [(CALDER)](https://caldercenter.org/) at the American Institutes for Research. I hold a M.S. in Applied Economics from [Montana State University](https://www.montana.edu/), a B.A. in Economics, and a B.S. in Statistics, both from [Western Washington University](https://www.wwu.edu/). 

My [research](/publications/) focuses on the economics of education and K-12 education policy, with a particular interest in academic pathways and how education policies and procedures shape student outcomes. My recent work examines access to Advanced Placement courses and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on student achievement.
